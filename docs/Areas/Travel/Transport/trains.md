Slawomir Nosal is a friend of mine who always shares the best tips on how to get to places by train. Below are some of them.

From the south of Poland to Prague, get a train ticket to Chalupki and then another ticket from Bohumin to Prague. It is the same train. You just must ride like a rabbit for 5 minutes between those two places.

From Ljubljana to the south of Poland, get a Flixbus to Wien Hbf, and then train ticket to Bohum√≠n and from Chalupki to the final destination. The train from Wien to Przemysl is by IC Porta Moravica which has a panoramic carriage in the 1st class. Highly recommended.
