Here, I share all the stuff. This is my brain dumped onto a website - notes, thoughts, cool links. I originally made it to keep track of my things, but you might find something neat in here too. Everything's sorted in that sidebar on the left, with folders inside folders. The whole thing's constantly changing as I add new stuff and learn more.

I share it mostly because I think it might help people to figure out stuff and find interensting places in the world, meet people whom i meet and live a good life.

Awoof!

## A quote

“I had lunch with a producer a few years ago. At some point, I said, 'Every film I do, I have to believe that I’m making the best film that’s ever been made.' He was absolutely shocked by this. It never occurred to him that someone would think like that. And that, to me, was truly shocking—because films are really hard to make. They're all-consuming. Your family life and everything else goes into it for two years. So it had never occurred to me that there were people doing it who weren’t trying to make the best film that ever was. Why would you otherwise? Even if it’s not going to be the best film that’s ever been made, you have to believe it could.” ~Christopher Nolan

Hunter S. Thompson // "A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance... You have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else... But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living within that way of life. But you say, 'I don’t know where to look; I don’t know what to look for.' And there’s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don’t know...is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by deciding to look, you go a long way toward making the choice."
