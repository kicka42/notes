- Venice
  - Founded around 421 was a crucial trade hub between Europe and the East for centuries.
  - In 1583, Venice was the world's pleasure capital—rich, decadent, and sex-indulgent. It was known for the most beautiful women and outstanding fashion scene. It was the era of the courtesan, beautiful, clever, and witty women well-versed in music and poetry, among them was Veronica Franco, a distinguished poet and famous courtesan.
  - The major plague outbreak in 1575 killed one-third of the population.
  - In 1797, Napoleon, who despised Venice, attacked and plundered its artworks and treasures, and transported them to Paris. He also ordered the burning of Venetian symbols in San Marco Square, leaving the city in ruins and its spirit crushed.
  - The railway bridge connecting Venice to mainland Italy was completed in 1846, and by 1866, Venice had become part of Italy. Although it enhanced transportation, they are often regarded as a disaster because it symbolized the end of Venice's independence.
  - In the 19th century, poets, painters, and writers came to the city and started to make it again. They loved the atmospheric blend of decay and ancient beauty. Charles Dickens described it as `a strange, hallucinogenic dream, a city of fantasy, a place of infinite wonders.`

  - Places
    - Kto chce zaznać Wenecji prawdziwej, intymnej, powinien iść między Campo Santa Margherita (targ owocowy pod starymi platanami) a Rio di San Trovaso, przy którym parter jednego z pałaców został przekształcony w piwnicę z trunkami, na miejscu i na wynos. Można tu wychylić kieliszek przy ladzie w rozgadanym towarzystwie robotników, studentów, bliżej nieokreślonej bohemy.
