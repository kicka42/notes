I awoke with a hangover, the morning was quiet. I think the last night's concert of Brian Jonestown Massacre was worthwhile, in spite of the headache. I saw them once, at 8mm in Berlin, a small, intimate, spontaneous concert, two or three years ago, and they were fantastic. Yesterday was a blast. I liked it all very much as well.

I was lying and listening, and I didn't want to get out of bed, but when Smelly started meowing, running around and knocking things down, I had no choice. I started the day. Wednesday.

[[Mohn]] was busy dealing with her landlord, who wrote her a long email about the finances and apartment situation, so she needed to write him back and send proofs.
A new mug, originally from Alien Productions, beautifully made with two pictures of ALF on it, saying "I will diet tomorrow... let's check out the fridge" is now in the kitchen. [[Mohn]] found it and bought it. I wonder if one day they will make a remake of ALF. I hope not, I hope fucking not. 

It was rainy the whole afternoon. A day passed, and I did not go outside today.
