#Germany Berlin
I woke up late; the last night I stayed long watching 3 episodes of The Boys.

It was cloudy the whole day, and it wasn't cold, but there was no sun at all and I felt sleepy; I was happy for the weekend but, weekends are difficult to spend well, and usually they are energetically expensive unless I'm staying in bed and only reading books. Those are my best weekends.

I've been trying to get through one course on the subject of AI Agents called "Multi Al Agent Systems with crewAl" in the last few days and I can not manage it, somehow the time is passing extremely fast and I can not catch up with the day. I'm not lazy though.

I had a short walk, I saw people were watching the first football match of Euro 2024 everywhere. It is two hours to midnight. I read a news that, in the football fan zone, next to the Reichstag, they are going to build the largest bar in the world.

Tonight, I was supposed to meet with Katrina at Babylon Kino, next to Volksb√ºhne Theater, however, she wrote to me one hour before that she could not make it; I stayed home, trying to watch something but it was one of those nights that I was switching from one movie to another and did not finish any.

I went to bed slightly after midnight, I opened my Kindle and started to read a new chapter of Silo; I fell asleep after two pages.
