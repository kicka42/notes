#Germany Berlin

- I slept well and I'm pretty sure I had some dreams last night, I felt it when I opened my eyes.
- There is a huge difference between fake and real work; today I had a real one. The deep work focused on delivering specific tasks is truly satisfying and it is real work, a procrastination is a fake one.
- The day was short and I spent it mostly working on understanding RAG in Python by making a related project. I struggle to maintain my schedule, which often impacts my various interests, for example art and music.
- The day after tomorrow [[Adrian Kicka]] with his girlfriend Marcelina will be at my place for 3 nights. I shall tide up the place and fill up the fridge. I have no idea what we gonna do and what they want to see; my brother does not like cities and Marcelina I know not. I hope for good weather so we can stay outside. I don't like to stay with people at my place and the main reason for that is, that it is fucking small.
- The Euro 2024 commenced a few days ago, and this year, it is all happening in Germany. They put a long green passage of fake grass that leads to Brandenburg Tor, where the fan zone is. I heard that, they are not showing matches of the Polish team, but only Germans and finals matches.
- Estera asked me if I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket for the Fusion Festival. She's also looking for someone to help her with the juice business there. I have to think about that.
