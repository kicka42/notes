  #Germany Berlin
I slept well again for 7 hours and then tried to get out of bed for one hour. I probably had some dreams that night, although I can not recall any, it's too late to remember them.
Then, as usual, I went for a walk, did my exercises and had my breakfast; for the first time I have to say that I consider changing my oatmeal for something else, but what?
My French lessons went well, I moved to Unit 7 of The Pimsleur learning method.
Chloe, a friend of Poziomka, said that she will definitely be renting her apartment in Paris in December. I would like to be there in September. Johannes, a friend of Melina, and a man whom I know, is looking for a room or a flat in Berlin, for 3 months or even longer, since August; he would be perfect for 3 months in my place.
[[DD]] called me around noon and said that today, he is working from a library in Leszno, his new potential office to do work or rather fake work; I have no delusion.
I went for a walk, and while I picked up a parcel from the Amazon locker, I found out that I could open the Amazon app at my place and then use it to open the locker, without having internet outside.
I had my coffee in the afternoon and wrap with rice, vegetables and salmon for late dinner. It was perfect, perfect, perfect.
Here is great news, tonight is the premiere of the last season of The Boys series.
